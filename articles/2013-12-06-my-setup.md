Several people have asked lately which is my setup, sometimes I just can't
answer directly because it varies a lot in which kind of suite they are
interested in: editor, mail client, OS, etc... I explain this in full detail
here.

## Machine

I have two machines: an Asus G74VW like
[this one](http://www.asus.com/ROG\_ROG/G75VW) and an Acer Aspire One D270 like
[this one](http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/series/aspireone).

The first one is a beast in almost all metrics (size, computing power, energy
consumption) and the latter is it's total inverse and the one I use most of
the time.

## Operational System

Currently I'm using Arch and the experience has been incredible. It's as
simple as it gets, the package manager is awesome and the community as well.

They have extensive documentation for almost anything that you want to do. I
just had to use
[this article](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Acer\_Aspire\_One)
to avoid any hardware compatibility issue.

Every package is very well crafted to not interfere with anything else. If you
installed a daemon, for example, it is not autostarted on boot by default.

That's were [Systemd](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd) comes into
scene, a modern service manager that is easy to use and configure.

## Window Manager

I used many flavours of full desktop environments: KDE, Gnome 2, Gnome 3,
Unity, LXDE, XFCE.

As for pure window managers I used
[Ratpoison](http://www.nongnu.org/ratpoison/) and
[wmii](https://code.google.com/p/wmii/), which are great.

But today I found that [Xmonad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xmonad) is the
way to go: incredibly lightweight, fast, reliable and compatible with almost
anything you may need in your desktop environment.

You can check my configuration
[here](https://github.com/badosu/dotfiles/blob/master/.xmonad/xmonad.hs).

## Desktop Environment

I tried many panels with xmonad: the old-school gnome2 panel, the unity dock,
kde bar, xfce panel but none of them beats a well-configured
xmobar [(config)](https://github.com/badosu/dotfiles/blob/master/.xmobarrc).

Sometimes I don't need a graphical session, for reading emails or RSS for
example, but I still need a network manager. Usually it is hard to use command
line interfaces for networking but fortunately there is
[Wicd](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wicd), that makes managing wireless
connections painless.

A list of the programs and configs that I use to have a full Desktop Envirnoment:

* Terminal: Urxvt [(config)](https://github.com/badosu/dotfiles/blob/master/.Xresources)
* Email Client: Mutt [(config)](https://github.com/badosu/dotfiles/tree/master/.mutt) with offlineimap-notify [(config)](https://github.com/badosu/dotfiles/blob/master/.offlineimaprc)
* Text Editor: Vim and Gvim [(config)](https://github.com/badosu/dotvim)
* Appearance: [FlatStudio](http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/FlatStudio?content=154296), [Clarity](http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Clarity?content=135654), LXAppearance, Compton [(config)](https://github.com/badosu/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/compton.conf)
* Launcher: dmenu and yeganesh [(config)](https://github.com/badosu/dotfiles/blob/master/.xmonad/xmonad.hs#L61)
* Systray: Stalonetray [(config)](https://github.com/badosu/dotfiles/blob/master/.stalonetrayrc)
* RSS: Newsbeuter [(config)](https://github.com/badosu/dotfiles/blob/master/.newsbeuter)
* Applets: batterymon and volumeicon
* Libnotify: dunst
* File Manager: thunar
* Image Visualization: sxiv
* Wallpaper: hsetroot

The `.xinitrc` file is run before xmonad, wrapping everything together,
[check it out](https://github.com/badosu/dotfiles/blob/master/.xinitrc).

## How it looks like

It is beautiful, fast, reliable, light and responsive. This is importante since
the hardware spec of the netbook is very modest.

The launcher, xmonad tiled window handling and workspaces make it easy to create
and manage all the open applications.

The dock is very informative and can be hidden with a single keystroke.

The composition manager creates nice shadows and transition effects on the
windows, together with the custom appearance makes the desktop very beautiful.

## What matters

What matters is a desktop that is suited for your needs, maybe you just don't
need or want a fully customized setup, but seeing what other people are using
may bring you some surprises.
